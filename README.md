# Duck
A minimal website (for those that can't install the [macOS version of the Duck app](https://github.com/jessemillar/duck/releases)) that displays a rubber duck image on your screen for when a physical rubber duck is not present. but a [rubber duck debugging session](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) is needed.

Inspired by (and stolen from) the [Stack Exchange rubber duck April Fools' joke](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/308564/stack-exchange-has-been-taken-over-by-a-rubber-duck).
