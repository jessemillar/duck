# Duck
Rubber duck debugging is [a real thing](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) and very useful.

This repo represents a minimal macOS application that displays a rubber duck image on your screen for when a physical rubber duck is not present.

Inspired by (and stolen from) the [Stack Exchange rubber duck April Fools' joke](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/308564/stack-exchange-has-been-taken-over-by-a-rubber-duck). Code is based off the minimal Electron application from the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.
