# Duck

Inspired by (and stolen from) the [Stack Exchange rubber duck April Fool's joke](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/308564/stack-exchange-has-been-taken-over-by-a-rubber-duck). Code is based off the minimal Electron application from the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.
